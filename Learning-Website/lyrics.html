            Uptown got it's hustlers
            The bowery got it's bums
            42nd street got big Jim Walker
            He's a pool shootin' son of a gun
            Yeah, he's big and dumb as a man can come
            But he's stronger than a country hoss
            And when the bad folks all get together at night
            You know they all call big Jim boss, just because
            And they say
            You don't tug on Superman's cape
            You don't spit into the wind
            You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
            And you don't mess around with Jim
            Well, outta south Alabama came a country boy
            He said I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
            I am a pool shootin' boy
            My name's Willie McCoy
            But down home, they call me Slim
            Yeah, I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd street
            He drivin' a drop top cadillac
            Last week, he took all my money
            And it may sound funny
            But I come to get my money back
            And everybody say, Jack uh, don't you know
            And you don't tug on Superman's cape
            You don't spit into the wind
            You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
            And you don't mess around with Jim
            Well, a hush fell over the pool room
            Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
            And when the cuttin' were done
            The only part that wasn't bloody
            Was the soles of the big man's feet
            Yeah, he was cut in in 'bout a hundred places
            And he was shot in a couple more
            And you better believe
            They sung a different kind of story
            When big Jim hit the floor
            Now they say
            You don't tug on Superman's cape
            You don't spit into the wind
            You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
            And you don't mess around with Slim
            Yeah, big Jim got his hat
            Find out where it's at
            And it's not hustlin' people strange to you
            Even if you do got a two-piece custom made pool cue
            Yeah, you don't tug on Superman's cape
            You don't spit into the wind
            You don't pull the mask off the old lone ranger
            And you don't mess around with Slim
